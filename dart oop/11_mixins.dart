/*
 * üìñ WHAT ARE MIXINS?
 
 *  MIXIN: A way to share code between classes without inheritance
 *         Like adding extra abilities to a class - "mix in" new features
 *         Uses the 'mixin' keyword to create reusable code blocks
 
 *  WITH: The keyword to add a mixin to a class
 *        Like saying "this class comes WITH these extra abilities"
 *        Can use multiple mixins: 'with Mixin1, Mixin2'
 
 * ü§î WHY MIXINS?: Some animals walk, some crawl, some fly - but not all
 *               You can't put walk() in Animal class because snakes don't walk!
 *               Mixins let you pick and choose abilities
 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If 2 mixins have the same method, the last one wins
 *             Like if both CanWalkMixin and CanSwimMixin have a method called move(),
 *             the one from CanSwimMixin will be used if both are mixed in
 
 & üîë KEY CONCEPTS:
 * mixin = reusable code that can be mixed into classes
 * 'with' keyword adds mixin abilities to a class
 * Animals get only the movement they actually use
 * More flexible than putting everything in parent class
 * Can use multiple mixins: 'with CanWalkMixin, CanSwimMixin'
 * Last mixin wins if there are method name conflicts
 
 ^ ‚úÖ WHY MIXINS ARE BETTER:
 * Each animal gets ONLY the abilities it needs
 * Code is reused without forcing unwanted methods
 * More flexible than single inheritance
 * Avoid "god classes" with too many methods
 * Mix and match capabilities as needed
 
 ! ‚ùå INHERITANCE PROBLEMS MIXINS SOLVE:
 * Can't put fly() in Animal - not all animals fly
 * Can't put swim() in Animal - not all animals swim
 * Single inheritance limitation (only one parent)
 * Forced methods that don't make sense for all children
 
 ~ üåü REAL WORLD COMPARISON:
 * Inheritance: 'A house IS A building'
 * Mixin: 'A house WITH electricity, WITH plumbing'
 * You can mix and match features exactly as needed!

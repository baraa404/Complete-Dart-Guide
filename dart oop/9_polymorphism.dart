/*
 * WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM?
 
 * POLYMORPHISM: Greek word meaning "many forms"
 *               One method name, many different implementations
 *               Like pressing "play" on different devices - TV, radio, phone - each plays differently
 
 * RUNTIME RESOLUTION: The program decides which method to call while it's running
 *                     Like choosing the right "move" method when you don't know if it's a car or plane
 
 * SAME INTERFACE: All objects can be called the same way, even if they behave differently
 *                 Like all vehicles having a "start()" method, but cars and planes start differently
 
 * DYNAMIC BINDING: The correct method is chosen automatically based on the actual object type
 *                  Like the program knowing to call "Car.move()" even if stored as "Vehicle"
 
 & KEY CONCEPTS:
 * Same method name (play), different implementations in each class
 * Parent reference can hold child objects
 * Correct method chosen automatically at runtime
 * Makes code flexible - can add new instruments easily
 * One interface, many forms of behavior
 
 ^ WHY IT'S POWERFUL:
 * Write code once, works with many types
 * Easy to add new types without changing existing code
 * Runtime flexibility and extensibility

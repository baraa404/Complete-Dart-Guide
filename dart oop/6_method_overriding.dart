/*
 * üìñ WHAT IS METHOD OVERRIDING?
 
 * üîÑ METHOD OVERRIDING: Changing the behavior of an inherited method in a child class
 *                   Like children doing things differently than their parents
 *                   Same method name, but different implementation
 
 * üè∑Ô∏è @override: An annotation that tells Dart you're intentionally changing a parent method
 *           Like putting a label that says "I'm doing this differently"
 *           Helps catch typos and makes code clearer
 
 * üë™ INHERITED METHOD: A method that comes from the parent class
 *                  Like learning skills from your parents
 *                  Child classes get all parent methods automatically
 
 & üîë KEY CONCEPTS:
 * Child class can change how parent methods work
 * Same method name and parameters as parent
 * Use @override annotation for clarity and safety
 * Child's version is called instead of parent's version
 * Can still call parent's version using super.methodName()
 
 ^ ‚úÖ BENEFITS:
 * Customize behavior for specific child classes
 * Keep same interface but change implementation
 * Polymorphism - same method call, different behavior
 * Code flexibility and specialization
 * Maintains consistency while allowing customization
 
 ! ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES:
 * Must have same method signature as parent
 * Use @override for safety and clarity
 * Can call parent method with super.methodName()
 * Child's implementation completely replaces parent's
 
 ~ üåü REAL WORLD EXAMPLES:
 * Animals making different sounds (dog barks, cat meows)
 * Vehicles starting differently (car ignition, bike kick-start)
 * Shapes calculating area differently (circle vs rectangle)
 * Students studying differently (visual, auditory, hands-on)

class Animal {
  String name;

  Animal(this.name);

  // This method will be inherited as-is

    print("$name is sleeping");

  print("--- Same Method, Different Behavior ---");
  genericAnimal.makeSound(); // Generic sound
  dog.makeSound(); // Dog-specific sound
  cat.makeSound(); // Cat-specific sound
  cow.makeSound(); // Cow-specific sound

  print("\n--- Inherited vs Overridden Methods ---");
  print("Sleep method (some inherited, some overridden):");
  dog.sleep(); // Inherited from Animal

// =================================================================
// PRACTICE TASK
// =================================================================

/*
 * TASK: Create method overriding example
 * 
 * 1. Create a "Shape" class with:
 *    - name (String) property
 *    - getArea() method that returns 0.0 (for unknown shapes)
 * 
 * 2. Create a "Circle" class that extends Shape:
 *    - Add radius (double) property
 *    - Override getArea() to return pi * radius * radius (use 3.14 for pi)
 * 
 * 3. Test by creating both Shape and Circle objects, call getArea() and print the results
 * 
 * This covers: @override annotation, method overriding, different behavior
 */
